              The Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program is a global group

            <p class="who-are-eager">
              who are eager to help students and their communities, lead in
              their local techcircles, and develop technical and career skills
              for the future. As a Student Ambassador, you might find yourself
              organising a campus or community hackathon, mentoring other
              students, or volunteering with an elementary school STEM class.
              Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors are a global community of
              university students who passionately share their knowledge with
              their peers. However, it’s not enough to be a budding technologist
              that can amplify to the broad community – we also expect that
              Student Ambassadors exemplify Microsoft values and display
              community spirit in a positive way by conducting themselves with
              respect and restraint whenever they engage with others within and
              outside the Program. Simply put, an individual’s character and
              leadership truly matter to us.
